# WGAN for Financial Time-Series Generation
By Bernardo Ramírez

This repository contains an implementation of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) for generating synthetic financial time-series data. The project explores the application of advanced GAN frameworks within the financial domain, specifically for modeling complex time-series data. The model is demonstrated on historical price data for AAPL stock, with included results showcasing the model's performance.

Overview
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained significant attention for their success in generating highly realistic synthetic images, leading to advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Although GANs have set new standards in fields where visual inspection aids model evaluation, their application to domains such as financial time-series remains challenging due to the difficulty in assessing the quality of generated data.

In this project, we investigate the potential of GANs to generate synthetic financial time-series data. The goal is to create a universal framework that can learn the underlying distribution of financial data and produce realistic synthetic sequences that maintain essential statistical properties of the original data. This work specifically implements a WGAN-GP model, wich is known for working well with financial data distributions.

Technical Summary
This project leverages the WGAN-GP architecture to model and generate financial time-series data, emphasizing the following elements:

Model Architecture: The generator and discriminator networks are designed to capture the intricate patterns and statistical dependencies of financial data sequences.
Gradient Penalty: The model incorporates a gradient penalty term in the discriminator's loss function, enhancing training stability and helping the model converge to a more realistic distribution.
Evaluation Metrics: The synthetic data generated by the model is evaluated using multiple statistical benchmarks to assess its quality and fidelity in replicating the real data distribution.
The model was applied to historical AAPL stock price data, where it demonstrated strong performance in replicating the underlying statistical properties of the real dataset.
Report: After analysis, we captured the results of the model in one jupyter fyle for a better understanding of the model.
Abstract
The success of GANs in generating realistic synthetic images has spurred a new field of research focused on synthetic data generation across various domains. This progress, however, has largely been limited to fields like image and video processing, where visual assessment serves as a natural guide for evaluating model output. Applying GANs to financial data is more complex, as synthetic time-series data requires thorough statistical analysis to evaluate its quality.

This project applies GANs to the financial domain by generating synthetic time-series data. Specifically, a WGAN-GP architecture was implemented to learn and replicate the distributions present in financial datasets. The model was trained and evaluated using historical EUR/USD Forex data, achieving strong performance across multiple statistical measures. Results suggest that WGAN-GP can serve as a robust probabilistic model for forecasting and scenario generation in financial time-series applications.
